### Features

- Add subtitle files (SRT or WebVTT) to your video for reading along and shadowing.
- Custom video controls for language learning and shadowing (A/B repeat, slow playback, quick rewind, etc.).
- Easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts for efficient practice.
- Volume amplification (VLC style).
- All processing is local—your videos and subtitles never leave your device.


### Why language learning & shadowing?

Shadowing is a proven technique for language acquisition, especially for improving intonation, rhythm, and pronunciation. This player is designed to make shadowing easy and effective by providing:

- Fine-grained playback controls (slow down, repeat, jump back)
- Subtitle support for reading and listening simultaneously
- A distraction-free interface focused on language practice


The player is also secure: all video and subtitle processing happens locally in your browser, so your files are never uploaded anywhere.
