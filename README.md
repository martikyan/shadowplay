ShadowPlay is a browser-based video player designed for language learners to practice shadowing, improve intonation, and master pronunciation.

Play your own videos locally in the browser, add subtitles (SRT or WebVTT), and use custom controls crafted for language learning and shadowing practice.


### Features

- Add subtitle files (SRT or WebVTT) to your video for reading along and shadowing.
- Custom video controls for language learning and shadowing (A/B repeat, slow playback, quick rewind, etc.).
- Easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts for efficient practice.
- Volume amplification (VLC style).
- All processing is local—your videos and subtitles never leave your device.


### Why language learning & shadowing?

Shadowing is a proven technique for language acquisition, especially for improving intonation, rhythm, and pronunciation. This player is designed to make shadowing easy and effective by providing:

- Fine-grained playback controls (slow down, repeat, jump back)
- Subtitle support for reading and listening simultaneously
- A distraction-free interface focused on language practice


The player is also secure: all video and subtitle processing happens locally in your browser, so your files are never uploaded anywhere.
